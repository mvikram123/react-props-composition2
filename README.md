# React Composition 2

##### Create a Modal component that accepts a show prop and a onClose callback. 

The component should render its children inside a modal dialog that is displayed when the show prop is true. 

When the user clicks the "close" button in the dialog, the onClose callback should be called to update the show prop to false.

- Use class name `model-overlay` for model container.
